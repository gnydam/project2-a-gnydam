## PART 1  - Complete grab_headlines
## INPUT: soup - the soup object to process
## Grab the headlines from the "Most Read" section
## and return them in a list
def grab_headlines(soup):
    mostRead = soup.find_all('div', class_ = "view-most-read")
    tags = mostRead[0].find_all('a')
    li_of_titles = []
    for item in tags:
        li_of_titles.append(item.get_text())
    return (li_of_titles)

## PART 2 Complete a function called get_headline_dict. It will take a soup object and return a dictionary
## with each story headline as a key and each story url as the value
## INPUT: soup - the soup object
## OUTPUT: Return - a dictionary with each story headline as the key and the story url as the value
def get_headline_dict(soup):
    stories = soup.find_all('div', class_ = 'storywrap')

        title = a_tag.get_text()
        url = a_tag['href']
        d[title] = url
    return d


## PART 3 Define a function called get_page_info. It will take a soup object for a story
## and return a tuple with the title, author, date, and the number of paragraphs
## in the body of the story
## INPUT: soup - the soup object
## OUTPUT: Return - a tuple with the title, author, date, and number of paragraphs
def get_page_info(soup):
    title = soup.find('div', class_ = 'pane-node-title').find('h2').get_text()
    date = soup.find('div', class_ = 'pane-node-created').find('div', class_ = 'pane-content').get_text()
    writer = soup.find('div', class_ = 'byline').find('a').get_text()
    num_paragraph = len(soup.find('div', class_ = 'field-type-text-with-summary').find_all('p'))
    tup = (title, date, writer, num_paragraph)
    return tup

## Extra Credit
## INPUT: the dictionary that was returned from part 2
## OUTPUT: a new dictionary with just items that contain the word U-M or Ann Arbor
def find_mich_stuff(dicto):
    new_d = {}
    for key in dicto:
        AA = re.findall(r'\bAnn Arbor', key)

        if AA != []:
            new_d[key] = dicto[key]
        elif UM != []:
